# Enter at your own Risk. Next Stop. Startup.

> A very simple Startup Poster.

## Usage

* Poster
* Wallpaper
* Images in blog post and articles
* [insert your own choice]

## Updates

In the wake of advancements in Generative AI and prompt-based image creation, my work may seem somewhat repetitive. However, it continues to be the simplest yet impactful representation of a poster symbolizing the Startup universe. ;-)

I've tried a few AI-generated imagery and are included in the `ai` folder. Have fun.
